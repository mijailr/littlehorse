While the LittleHorse Server only understands the protobuf format of the WfSpec, the well-defined nature of the data format allowed LittleHorse to create SDK\'s in Java and GoLang that let you create WfSpecs from natural code. Since most of the LittleHorse concepts map nicely to programming concepts, this is a very natural and easy way to define your WfSpecs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/conditionals":{"id":"concepts/conditionals","title":"Conditional Branching","description":"Just as if/else allows you to implement control flow in your programs, Conditional Branching allows you to add control flow to your LittleHorse Workflows.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/exception-handling":{"id":"concepts/exception-handling","title":"Exception Handling","description":"When things go wrong, LittleHorse has got you covered.
